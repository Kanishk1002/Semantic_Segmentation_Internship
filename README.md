## Introduction

Cell segmentation is a crucial task in biomedical image analysis, as it serves as a foundation for various downstream applications such as cell counting, tracking, and morphology analysis. This research report aims to compare the performance of several popular cell segmentation algorithms on a specific dataset of cell images and masks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study consists of a collection of cell images along with corresponding ground truth masks for cell segmentation. 

## Algorithms

The following segmentation algorithms are compared in this study:

- UNET
- RESUNET
- MULTIRESUNET
- VGG16
- VGG19 Pretrained
- ATTENTION UNET
- DEEPLAB V3+

Each algorithm's implementation and reports can be found in their respective directories.

## Evaluation Metrics

The algorithms are evaluated based on the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Jaccard Score
- Recall
- Precision

A detailed explanation of these metrics and their relevance to the task can be found in there.
